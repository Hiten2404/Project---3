# GovJobAlert - Project Progress Tracker

This document tracks the development progress of the GovJobAlert application, outlining completed milestones, current objectives, and future goals.

---

### **Project Goal**
To build a comprehensive, data-driven government job portal for India, featuring automated data collection, a robust database, and an intuitive user interface.

---

### **Current Status**
The application now uses a **real SQLite database** that runs inside the browser (via WebAssembly). The mock API has been replaced with a new data layer that executes live SQL queries for all data fetching, filtering, and pagination.

The project has successfully completed the **Database Setup** phase and is ready for true backend integration when deployed to a server environment.

### âœ… **Phase 1: Frontend Prototyping (Completed)**

- **[x] Initial Project Setup:**
    - Basic HTML, React, and TypeScript structure is in place.
- **[x] Core UI Components:**
    - All necessary reusable components (`Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Badge`, `Skeleton`) have been built and styled.
- **[x] Application Layout:**
    - Main layout including Header, Footer, and content area is complete.
- **[x] Job Display:**
    - `JobCard` and `JobList` components are implemented to display job postings effectively.
- **[x] Search & Filtering:**
    - A comprehensive search and filtering component (`SearchFilters`) with basic and advanced options is functional.
- **[x] Mock Data Simulation:**
    - The application was initially populated with realistic mock data.

### âœ… **Phase 2: Database & Backend API Layer (Completed)**

This phase has been successfully completed by simulating the database environment within the browser.

1.  **Database Setup:**
    - **[x] Create the SQLite database:** An in-browser SQLite database is initialized on app load using `sql.js` (WebAssembly).
    - **[x] Define the database schema:** The `jobs`, `categories`, and `locations` tables have been created using the exact SQL schemas from the PRD.
    - **[x] Apply performance indexes:** Performance indexes have been created to ensure fast queries.
    - **[x] Seed Initial Data:** The database is populated with the initial set of jobs from the mock data files.

2.  **Backend API Development (Simulated):**
    - **[x] Create a Database-Backed API Layer:** The `lib/mockApi.ts` has been replaced with a new `lib/api.ts`. This new service connects to the in-browser database and executes real SQL queries for all data operations.
    - **[x] Implement `getJobs` with SQL:** The main job fetching function now dynamically builds and runs `SELECT` queries with `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `OFFSET` clauses to handle all filtering, sorting, and pagination.

### ðŸš€ **Phase 3: Full Stack Integration & Automation (Next Steps)**

The application is now perfectly architected to be connected to a real, server-hosted backend. The next steps involve creating the HTTP layer and adding user-centric features.

1.  **User Features (In Progress):**
    - **[x] Implement "Save Job" functionality:**
        -   Used `localStorage` to persist saved jobs.
        -   Added a "Show Saved Jobs" filter.
        -   Updated the UI to reflect saved status (e.g., filled heart icon).
    - **[ ] Implement Job Detail View:**
        -   **Current Task:** Create a view to show full details for a single job.
        -   Simulate navigation using component state.
        -   Fetch job data by ID, including related jobs.

2.  **Backend Server Development:**
    - [ ] Set up a Node.js server environment (e.g., using Next.js API Routes).
    - [ ] Install server-side libraries (`drizzle-orm`, `better-sqlite3`).
    - [ ] Create the actual HTTP API endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/jobs`, `POST /api/jobs/bulk`). The logic from `lib/api.ts` can be moved here with minimal changes.
    - [ ] Connect the frontend to these new HTTP endpoints.

3.  **Automation Workflow:**
    - [ ] Develop the n8n / Make.com workflow using the prompt provided to scrape jobs and post them to the live `POST /api/jobs/bulk` endpoint.

4.  **Deployment:**
    - [ ] Deploy the full-stack application to a hosting provider.
