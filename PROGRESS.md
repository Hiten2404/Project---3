# GovJobAlert - Project Progress Tracker

This document tracks the development progress of the GovJobAlert application, outlining completed milestones, current objectives, and future goals.

---

### **Project Goal**
To build a comprehensive, data-driven government job portal for India, featuring automated data collection, a robust database, and an intuitive user interface.

---

### **Current Status**
The application is **feature-complete** and architected as a full-stack Next.js application. It is powered by a live, cloud-based **Turso (libSQL) database** and uses the **Drizzle ORM** for all data operations. The final step is to deploy the application and activate the automated AI data-sourcing pipeline using **n8n**, which will make the system fully autonomous.

### âœ… **Phase 1: Frontend Prototyping (Completed)**

- **[x] Initial Project Setup:**
    - Basic HTML, React, and TypeScript structure is in place.
- **[x] Core UI Components:**
    - All necessary reusable components (`Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Badge`, `Skeleton`) have been built and styled.
- **[x] Application Layout:**
    - Main layout including Header, Footer, and content area is complete.
- **[x] Job Display:**
    - `JobCard` and `JobList` components are implemented to display job postings effectively.
- **[x] Search & Filtering:**
    - A comprehensive search and filtering component (`SearchFilters`) with basic and advanced options is functional.
- **[x] Mock Data Simulation:**
    - The application was initially populated with realistic mock data.

---

### âœ… **Phase 2: Simulated Backend (Completed)**

This phase served as a bridge to a full-stack architecture and has been successfully completed and superseded.

- **[x] In-Browser Database Setup:**
    - An in-browser SQLite database was initialized using `sql.js` (WebAssembly).
    - The database was seeded with initial data to simulate a live backend.
- **[x] Database-Backed API Layer:**
    - A data service was created to execute live SQL queries against the in-browser database for all filtering, sorting, and pagination, proving the data model before migrating to a live database.

---

### âœ… **Phase 3: Full Stack Integration (Completed)**

The application has been fully migrated to a server-centric architecture using Next.js and a cloud database.

1.  **Architecture Migration:**
    - **[x] Convert to Next.js:** The project has been restructured into a full-stack Next.js application.
    - **[x] Cloud Database Integration:** Switched from an in-browser database to a live, cloud-based Turso database.
    - **[x] Implement Drizzle ORM:** All database queries have been rewritten using Drizzle ORM for type safety and better developer experience.
    - **[x] Database Management Scripts:** Created scripts for pushing schema changes (`db:push`) and seeding data (`db:seed`).

2.  **User Features:**
    - **[x] Implement "Save Job" functionality:**
        -   Used `localStorage` to persist saved jobs.
        -   Added a "Show Saved Jobs" filter.
        -   Updated the UI to reflect saved status (e.g., filled heart icon).
    - **[x] Implement Job Detail View:**
        -   Created a dedicated view to show full details for a single job.
        -   Implemented navigation and data fetching for the detail view, including related jobs.

3.  **Backend Server Development:**
    - **[x] Create HTTP API Endpoints:** Built all necessary API routes (`GET /api/jobs`, `GET /api/jobs/[id]`, `GET /api/meta`) in the Next.js `pages/api` directory.
    - **[x] Create Bulk Import API:** Built and secured the `POST /api/jobs/bulk` endpoint to allow for programmatic data insertion.

### ðŸš€ **Phase 4: Deployment & Automation with n8n (Final Step)**

The core application is complete. This final phase involves deploying the application and setting up a scheduled workflow in n8n to make the job portal fully autonomous.

1.  **[ ] Deploy the GovJobAlert Application:**
    -   Host the Next.js application on a platform like **Vercel** to get a live, public URL.
    -   Configure all required environment variables (`TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `AUTOMATION_SECRET_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) in the Vercel project settings.

2.  **[ ] Set Up an n8n Instance:**
    -   Deploy an n8n instance using **n8n Cloud** or a self-hosting provider like **Render** or **Railway**.
    -   Set an environment variable in the n8n instance: `VERCEL_APP_URL` = (Your live Vercel URL from Step 1).

3.  **[ ] Configure n8n Credentials:**
    -   Inside your n8n dashboard, navigate to "Credentials".
    -   Create a **Google Gemini API** credential using your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
    -   Create a **Header Auth** credential for your `AUTOMATION_SECRET_KEY` (Name: `Authorization`, Value: `Bearer your-secret-key`).

4.  **[ ] Import and Activate the Workflow:**
    -   In n8n, import the `n8n-workflow.json` file from this project.
    -   Link the workflow nodes to the credentials you just created.
    -   **Activate** the workflow to enable the daily schedule.
    
5.  **[ ] Launch and Monitor:**
    -   Manually execute the workflow in n8n for an initial test run.
    -   Verify that new jobs are successfully scraped and appear on your live Vercel site.
    -   Monitor the first few scheduled runs to ensure the autonomous system is working correctly.
