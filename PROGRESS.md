# GovJobAlert - Project Progress Tracker

This document tracks the development progress of the GovJobAlert application, outlining completed milestones, current objectives, and future goals.

---

### **Project Goal**
To build a comprehensive, data-driven government job portal for India, featuring automated data collection, a robust database, and an intuitive user interface.

---

### **Current Status**
The application is **feature-complete** and has been successfully migrated to a full-stack Next.js architecture. It is now powered by a live, cloud-based **Turso (libSQL) database** and uses the **Drizzle ORM** for all data operations. All necessary API endpoints for fetching data and bulk importing have been built and secured. The project is ready for deployment and the implementation of its automated data-sourcing pipeline.

---

### âœ… **Phase 1: Frontend Prototyping (Completed)**

- **[x] Initial Project Setup:**
    - Basic HTML, React, and TypeScript structure is in place.
- **[x] Core UI Components:**
    - All necessary reusable components (`Card`, `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Badge`, `Skeleton`) have been built and styled.
- **[x] Application Layout:**
    - Main layout including Header, Footer, and content area is complete.
- **[x] Job Display:**
    - `JobCard` and `JobList` components are implemented to display job postings effectively.
- **[x] Search & Filtering:**
    - A comprehensive search and filtering component (`SearchFilters`) with basic and advanced options is functional.
- **[x] Mock Data Simulation:**
    - The application was initially populated with realistic mock data.

---

### âœ… **Phase 2: Simulated Backend (Completed)**

This phase served as a bridge to a full-stack architecture and has been successfully completed and superseded.

- **[x] In-Browser Database Setup:**
    - An in-browser SQLite database was initialized using `sql.js` (WebAssembly).
    - The database was seeded with initial data to simulate a live backend.
- **[x] Database-Backed API Layer:**
    - A data service was created to execute live SQL queries against the in-browser database for all filtering, sorting, and pagination, proving the data model before migrating to a live database.

---

### âœ… **Phase 3: Full Stack Integration & Automation (Completed)**

The application has been fully migrated to a server-centric architecture using Next.js and a cloud database.

1.  **Architecture Migration:**
    - **[x] Convert to Next.js:** The project has been restructured into a full-stack Next.js application.
    - **[x] Cloud Database Integration:** Switched from an in-browser database to a live, cloud-based Turso database.
    - **[x] Implement Drizzle ORM:** All database queries have been rewritten using Drizzle ORM for type safety and better developer experience.
    - **[x] Database Management Scripts:** Created scripts for pushing schema changes (`db:push`) and seeding data (`db:seed`).

2.  **User Features:**
    - **[x] Implement "Save Job" functionality:**
        -   Used `localStorage` to persist saved jobs.
        -   Added a "Show Saved Jobs" filter.
        -   Updated the UI to reflect saved status (e.g., filled heart icon).
    - **[x] Implement Job Detail View:**
        -   Created a dedicated view to show full details for a single job.
        -   Implemented navigation and data fetching for the detail view, including related jobs.

3.  **Backend Server Development & Automation:**
    - **[x] Create HTTP API Endpoints:** Built all necessary API routes (`GET /api/jobs`, `GET /api/jobs/[id]`, `GET /api/meta`) in the Next.js `pages/api` directory.
    - **[x] Create Bulk Import API:** Built the `POST /api/jobs/bulk` endpoint to allow for programmatic data insertion.

### ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

The core application is feature-complete. The final step is to build and deploy the automation pipeline.

1.  **Deploy the GovJobAlert Application:**
    -   Host the Next.js application on a platform like **Vercel** to get a live, public URL.
    -   This is a prerequisite for the automation service to have a target API to send data to.

2.  **Set Up the Automation Engine (n8n):**
    -   Deploy a self-hosted **n8n** instance using a **free 24/7 strategy** on the **Render** cloud platform.
    -   This involves using a free Render PostgreSQL database for persistent workflow storage and a free Render Web Service to run the n8n application.
    -   Implement a "keep-alive" service (like Uptime Robot) to ensure the instance runs continuously.

3.  **Build the Web Scraping Workflow:**
    -   Within the deployed n8n instance, build a visual workflow that runs on a daily schedule.
    -   This workflow will:
        1.  Fetch HTML from target government job websites.
        2.  Extract job details (title, department, deadline, etc.).
        3.  Format the extracted data into the required JSON structure.
        4.  Send the formatted data to the live application's `POST /api/jobs/bulk` endpoint.

4.  **Launch and Monitor:**
    -   Activate the workflow and monitor its first few runs to ensure data is being added to the live application correctly.
    -   Maintain and enhance the application and workflow over time.
